            <p id="text">The types of hand signals cannot be well-recognized using only video sequences’ spatial information, so temporal information between video sequences should be included. A 3D convolution is an extension of a 2D convolution to include the time axis. The feature image group obtained from a 3D convolutional kernel contains the spatial-temporal information of the video that cannot be extracted using the 2D convolutional kernel[49]. Therefore, a 3D convolutional neural network was selected as a computer vision technique to recognize hand signals. MTSRPF should provide rapid alerting to the operator in case of improper operations. Therefore, the MTSRPF utilized edge computing devices for data processing. The recognition speed of hand signals is crucial, so a neural network with high recognition speed should be developed. However, many 3D-like convolutional neural networks exhibit low recognition speed when deployed on edge computing devices, as shown in Table 2.</p>

                Note: the test dataset was the crane hand signal dataset, and the test device was the NVIDIA Jetson TX2. The above models did not use deep learning inference optimizers such as TensorRT. The C3D recognition time was unavailable because it was too large to run on the TX2.
